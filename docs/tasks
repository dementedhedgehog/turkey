   * collision detection
      - check collisions before moving
      - return where collision occurred

      - scaling acceleration!
      - quad trees
      - internal edges
      - n moving bodies
      - ladders
      - collision handling: friction, hysterisis, programmable callbacks  
      - needs penetration resolution for two objects moving towards each other??


   * move camera
   * settings in python (debug etc)
       - screen boundaries
       - aabb bounding boxes


   * sprite implementation and animation
   * load sprites in python
   * set backgrounds in python
   * parallax

   * triggers in python.. collisions or collisions and inputs
   * particle system (to check the collision system)
   * dump a stack trace on error
   * screens/view contexts.. need an intro, main menu, etc
   * sound manager
   * resource cache  
   * widget library?

later
====
   * ui widget library
