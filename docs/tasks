tasks
=====

   * game_objects list with positions and bounding boxes
   * collision detection

   * collision handling
   * particle system (to check the collision system)
   * proper model view control architecture.. sooner rather than later (or does this make stuff slow for a simple and well-defined application?)
   * dump a stack trace on error
   * animation and proper sprite architecture
   * screens/view contexts.. need an intro, main menu, etc
   * sound manager
   * resource cache   

later
====
   * embed python
   * ui widget library
   * parallax, fake 3d tunnels, snow etc
   * quad tree for collision detection
   * particle system for flashy stuff

questions
=========
   * MVC looks like overkill.. but I'm leaving it in for the moment because it's easier to 
     pull it out later than to put it back in later.


done
