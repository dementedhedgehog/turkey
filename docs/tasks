      - quad trees?
      - internal edges / slopes
      - n moving bodies
      - ladders
      - collision handling: friction, hysterisis, programmable callbacks  
      - needs penetration resolution for two objects moving towards each other??

   * settings in python (debug etc)
       - screen boundaries
       - aabb bounding boxes

   * sprite implementation and animation

   * triggers in python.. collisions or collisions and inputs
